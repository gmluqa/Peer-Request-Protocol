# CAPTCHA_SOLVE
CAPTCHA_SOLVE is a peer 2 peer puzzle solving platform.

I came up with this idea when filling out captcha's to use sites, what if I could just have the puzzle be automated instead?

This repository is quite literally that, I am going to code it as they say "a lo guarro" but be hopeful about the fact that we do end up delivering on a proof-of-concept, and with some luck, a minimal-viable-product. Don't expect this repository to be super clean, I am starting this as a solo contributor.

For a proof-of-concept goal of this technology, the goal will be emitting an action on the web forum 4chan, starting a "thread". 

It will fulfill this action with the simple x step process:
  1. 
  2.
  3.
  4.
